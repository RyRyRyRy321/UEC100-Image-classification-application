# Use of neural network for food recognition to develop recipe retrieval applications

## Introduction
Recipe retrieval is one of the important applications of food image recognition. An example of this are people who would take pictures of their meals and are curious how to recreate the meal. By using food image recognition, they can identify the food, and able to generate ingredients to recreate the meal.

## Related work
There is already implementation of Recipe retrieval. This involves capturing an image of the food, and finding individual ingredients that food consist of.

## Project Goal
The goal of the project is to produce a neural network that can take an input of images of food and classify them which type of food it is.

## Scope and Delimitation
The project contains about one hundred classes, and it will limit into working in 10 classes from the dataset, for each class, it will randomly get 10 instances.
